## personal

did not have any health goals as such in 2024, but in 2025, targeting to reach healthy body weight, improved eating habits and consistent gym.
Hopefully, will have more points to talk about health in next year.

## travel

it was a good year in terms of travel for me, starting with Ahmedabad, then Darjeeling, Hong Kong, Macau, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and McLeodganj (Dharamshala). Did my first solo trip (Singapore). Overall, these were amazing experiences. Looking forward to more such travels.

## moving ahead
hopefully, will continue writing these articles in the coming times, and probably try to have more sections in yearly life reviews.
